Naive Bayes Accuracy:

Logistic Regression Accuracy:
	With stopwords: 
	Without stopwords: 

My accuracies did not improve with stopword filtering. I believe that the lack of improvement indicates that stopwords have very little impact on a classifier's decision. Because stopwords are extremely common in both spam and ham files, their presence does not have significant influence even when they are not filtered out.

Values chosen for logistic regression:
	Î» (Regularization Parameter) 	= 0.01, 0.05, 0.1
	Number of Iterations 			= 50
	Step Size (Learning Rate) 		= 0.05
