The program was created and tested on Windows 8.1 command prompt. It is a Python 2.7.10 program.

The program can be run from the command line as follows
	python main.py

MAKE SURE that the train and test folders are in the same directory as the program. If not, the program will be unable to train the classifiers or test their accuracy.

When run, the program will print the accuracy of the four naive bayes and logistic regression classifiers, both with and without stopwords. It may take some time to train and test the classifiers
